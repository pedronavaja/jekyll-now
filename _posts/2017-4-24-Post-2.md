title: A data-based breeding program for Cannabis sativa 
---

According to [The Arcview Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/), a major source of market research data on the cannabis market, sales of medical and recreational cannabis topped $7 Billion in 2016 in North America. This is a huge number, but it shouldn't come as that big of a surprise: in terms of population, 1 in 5 people in the United States now live in a state where cannabis is legal in some form or other:

This is great news for people in the 30 or so states where restrictions on access to cannabis have been loosened, and probably even better news for the entrepreneurs and other business folk who have gotten into the market early. Sufferers of chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, anxiety, chronic pain, [epilepsy](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-cannabis-marijuana-prescription-first-11-year-old-boy-billy-caldwell-epilepsy-a7711436.html) and potentially even [brain cancer](http://fortune.com/2017/02/07/gw-pharmaceuticals-marijuana-brain-cancer/) should also be excited, not only for the immediate access to relief that decriminalization offers, but also because of the longer-term possibility of finally being able to conduct serious scientific research on the benefits of cannabis-derived compounds.   

See, one of the most tragic consequences of cannabis prohibition has been the outright stifling of scientific research into the genetics, biochemistry, and pharmacology of this widely-consumed plant. As a result, almost all of the information we have about pot's health benefits is anecdotal, rooted in folk wisdom and unexamined with proper controls and scientific rigor.   

Luckily, groups like [Phylos Bioscience](http://www.phylosbioscience.com/), [GW Pharmaceuticals](https://www.gwpharm.com/) and [Steep Hill Labs](http://steephill.com/) have gotten to work on exploring the genetics and pharmacology of this long-forbidden plant. The genetics and genomics aspect is particularly exciting to me: I did my PhD research in molecular genetics and development, and happen to think that manipulating the DNA of living things is the closest one can come to wizardry without risking being burned at the stake by angry mobs (and, let's be honest, [there are still angry mobs](http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/) when it comes to genetic research).  

 Unfortunately for me, I don't live in a state where cannabis is legal, so I can't participate very easily in this exciting research. However, thanks to the careful and painstaking work of amateur cultivators across the world, there's actually a wealth of genealogical data available for thousands of strains of cannabis that have been cultivated over the years. Furthermore, with the rise of legal cannabis in tech-heavy states like Washington and California, much of that data has been made available online through sites like [leafly](https://www.leafly.com/) and [wikileaf](https://www.wikileaf.com/). For my second project at Metis Datascience, I decided to try and use statistical methods to design a breeding program for the optimization of THC content in cannabis breeding stocks. But before I get into the methods, a brief overview of cannabis genealogies: The *Cannabis* genus is composed of three distinct species which can readily hybridize with each other. Almost all of the genetic stocks in modern cannabis breeding are derived from two of the species, the tall-growing, warmth-loving *Cannabis sativa* and the heartier, more shrub-like *Cannabis indica*.

From these two original species, a huge number of unique varietals of cannabis have been developed, each bred to select for specific traits by dedicated breeders. Each resulting strain has a unique name, just like with any other cultivated species. Except where apples have names like Granny Smith, Pink Lady, Cortlandt, Honeycrisp and Golden Delicious, cannabis strains have names like Romulan, Girl Scout Cookies, Chernobyl, Headband and [Cat Piss](https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cat-piss). These names allow growers to keep track of traits like THC production, flavor profiles and psychoactive effects, allowing cultivators to follow them through successive generations.

For the most part, though, all this work has been done on the basis of guesswork and trial and error--not a lot of data-based decision making has fed into cannabis breeding operations. This is not to knock the work of very talented cultivators, of course. A great deal of very cool work has already been done. But we've now accumulated enough data about different cannabis strains that we can bring machine learning techniques to bear on the project and hopefully propel the field into new territory.   

For this project, I built a web scraper using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and set it loose on sites with complete genealogical data (i.e. both parents were known and listed for every strain) as well as price and THC content where possible. Since this was a linear regression-based project, I decided to use THC content, expressed as a percentage of total weight, as a continuous variable for the purposes of prediction. For the independent variables, I collapsed the parentage of every strain in the dataset into a one-hot encoded matrix using [Patsy](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0/API-reference.html). The idea was that this would allow me to ask a relatively simple question: Which strains have the biggest positive and negative effects on THC production?    

After that, it was just a matter of using one of the many linear regression modules included in [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html). In this case, I started with a standard linear model, but ended up with a pretty poor fit: adjusted R^2 started below .5 and just kept dropping as I fiddled with the features. Next, I tried shifting to a polynomial model, but ended up with what was a pretty clearly overfit model: great R^2, but failed miserably when it came time to predict the THC content of my reserved test set. After a few more rounds of fiddling, I settled on a strategy of using a polynomial model with cross validation that I then subjected to ElasticNet regularization to try and keep the overfitting under control. The model still didn't look great when I plotted the test data against predicted values:  

![Predicted vs Actual]({{ site.baseurl }}//images/2nd_order_poly_test_set_plot.png "Predicted vs Actual plot, 2nd degree polynomial model with ElasticNet")  
  
But at least it started putting out interpretable results! Ultimately, linear regression may not have been the best tool to use on a dataset that ended up being relatively small: in the time I had to work on the project, I was only able to gather complete data for ~250 strains, which meant there was a fair degree of sparseness in my features: most strains only had one or two progeny represented in the dataset, and as a result the model tended to favor strains with relatively few progeny but more exreme outcomes. Hopefully, with more time and better informatics tools, I'll be able to expand my analysis into something that more accurately reflects the heritability of traits in cannabis cultivation.
