First post! Still getting the hang of editing a blog in Markdown from the command line, so please excuse the bare bones look for now. This week in Metis, we did a sudden immersion in [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), which we used to analyze [NYC Subway Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).  
The project was structured as a request from an organization attempting to optimize their placement of street teams for increasing awareness and involvement of women in technology. We decided to use the MTA turnstyle data to find the subway stations with the highest foot traffic in NYC, but we wanted to increase the effectiveness of our placement by finding the subset of busiest stations in high-tech and high-income areas.  

Our first order of business was to identify the geographic regions we wanted to target. Using an [income dataset](http://zipatlas.com/us/ny/new-york/zip-code-comparison/median-household-income.htm) from the New York state government and a [dataset of startup concentrations by zipcode](https://nycfuture.org/pdf/New_Tech_City.pdf), we identified an area of projected peak interest in Manhattan:  

![High Income High Tech Zipcodes]({{ pedronavaja.github.io }}/images/High_Tech_High_Income.tiff "Neighborhoods with both high income and a high concentration of startup companies")  

Using this information, we were able to narrow down the top 3 best subway stops for recruiting tech-oriented individuals by comparing weekday turnstile volume:
