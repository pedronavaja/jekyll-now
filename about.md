I'm a biologist with a background in genetics and neural development. This blog is intended as a place to display the results of my own personal data science projects. I'm starting by writing up the projects I worked on during the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps), but I'll soon be adding further investigations.
